This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses a Redux store and caches the data with react-query

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run server`

This will launch a mock server on port 3001.<br />
The server will serve the content of the `db.json` file.
You can access db through [http://localhost:3001/article](http://localhost:3000)

### `npm run start:all`

This command will launch both `npm run start` and `npm run server` in parallel.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
